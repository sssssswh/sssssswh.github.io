## Project Overview

This project was developed in collaboration with Laiwu Lianyun Glass Company in China to create an automated system for detecting and precisely locating flaws in various types of glass products. The system needed to identify defects in real-time during the manufacturing process across flat, specialty, and decorative glass products.

## Key Contributions  
- Contributed to team efforts in **building a dataset** for glass defect detection, including:  
  - Collecting data from production lines
  - Employing **image processing techniques** to enhance defect features  
  - Manually labeling defects across different glass types
  - Establishing a comprehensive database categorized by defect types
- Developed a **comprehensive AI-based pipeline** using **deep learning models (YOLO)** for automated glass defect detection.
- Designed a multi-stage detection system to handle different types of defects (scratches, bubbles, inclusions, etc.)
- Presented project outcomes to clients and facilitated **system integration** into practical applications, ensuring seamless adoption and functionality in real-world settings.
- Trained production staff on system operation and basic troubleshooting procedures.

## Methodology
- Implemented advanced lighting systems to optimize defect visibility
- Developed custom image preprocessing techniques specific to transparent and reflective materials
- Created specialized data augmentation methods to increase training data diversity
- Applied transfer learning approaches to improve model generalization across glass types
- Designed a modular software architecture to allow for easy updates and customizations

## Achievements  
- Achieved **over 93% accuracy** in detecting flaws across various types of glass, including **flat, specialty, and decorative glass**.
- Successfully deployed the system in a production environment operating at full manufacturing speeds.
- Reduced manual inspection labor costs by approximately 70%.
- Decreased customer returns due to undetected defects by 85%.
- System capable of detecting defects as small as 0.5mm in size.

## Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, custom image processing libraries
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Interface**: Qt-based GUI for operator monitoring and control
- **Database**: MySQL for defect logging and quality reporting

## Impact
The implementation of this automated glass flaw detection system significantly improved product quality while reducing production costs for Laiwu Lianyun Glass Company. The system has become an integral part of their quality assurance process and has contributed to their reputation for high-quality glass products in the Chinese market.
