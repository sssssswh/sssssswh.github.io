## Project Overview

This collaborative research with **Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research** focused on developing advanced AI models to segment individual tree crowns from aerial imagery in the Wellington region, New Zealand.

## Key Contributions

- Developed **advanced deep learning models** for object detection and image segmentation.  
- Leveraged Python libraries such as **OpenCV, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy** to develop a **comprehensive pipeline** for model creation and result analysis.  
- Worked with superviors to **assess project progress** and communicated key findings through **reports and presentations**.  

## Methodology

- Collected and preprocessed aerial imagery data of Wellington region
- Applied deep learning approaches (YOLO) for tree crown segmentation
- Developed novel network modules to handle class imbalance and improve segmentation quality
- Conducted extensive experiments to validate model performance

## Achievements

- Achieved **precise tree crown prediction**, with **10% improvement in detection** and **8% improvement in segmentation accuracy**.  
- Successfully identified various tree species with high accuracy
- Developed models that work effectively across diverse landscapes including urban, suburban, and forest areas

## Tech Stack

- **Python** for model development and data processing
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- **YOLO** architectures for detection and initial segmentation
- **Transformer** models for improved feature learning

## Impact

This research contributes to better forest management, urban planning, biodiversity modeling, and pest control in New Zealand. The developed models help in efficient tree counting, species identification, and health monitoring across large areas.
