## Project Overview

This project was conducted in collaboration with two Chinese automotive manufacturers: **FAW (China First Automobile Works)** and **China National Heavy Duty Truck Group**. Traditional inspection methods faced significant challenges in terms of operational difficulty, low efficiency, environmental concerns, and safety issues. The goal of this project was to develop an automated system for precise detection and rapid positioning of weld seams on wheel hubs, a critical component in vehicle manufacturing quality control. 

## Key Contributions  
- Collaborated on **data collection, cleaning, and labeling**, followed by analysis to derive actionable insights.
- Built **targeted CNN models (YOLO)** to locate and detect weld seams on wheel hubs.
- Developed a lightweight object detection algorithm to ensure real-time processing capabilities.

## Methodology
- Selected appropriate industrial cameras and lenses and determined the type and material of light sources and background plates
- Created 3D visualization models to design the positional relationship between cameras and light sources
- Validated equipment parameters through data collection and evaluation in real-world environments
- Designed and optimized CNN architectures specifically for weld seam characteristics
- Implemented a dual-camera system: Camera A for weld seam identification and Camera B for position verification

## Achievements  
- Successfully deployed in **practical applications** at multiple production facilities.
- Achieved a **detection rate of 99.98%** with **positional accuracy under 0.3 cm**.
- System has been in operation for over 18 months with consistent performance.
- Implemented fully automated, unmanned operation that eliminates the four major deficiencies of traditional inspection: operational difficulty, low efficiency, environmental concerns, and safety issues.


## Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLO

## Impact
This system significantly improved quality control processes at both automotive manufacturers, leading to better product reliability, reduced waste, and enhanced production efficiency. The high accuracy and reliability of the detection system have made it a standard component in the wheel hub manufacturing process.
