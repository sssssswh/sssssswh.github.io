## Project Overview

This project was conducted in collaboration with two major Chinese automotive manufacturers: FAW (China First Automobile Works) and China National Heavy Duty Truck Group. The goal was to develop an automated system for precise detection and rapid positioning of weld seams on wheel hubs, a critical component in vehicle manufacturing quality control.

## Key Contributions  
- Collaborated on **data collection, cleaning, and labeling**, followed by analysis to derive actionable insights.
- Built **targeted CNN models (YOLO)** to locate and detect weld seams on wheel hubs.
- Regularly communicated with clients to provide updates and demonstrate project progress, ensuring alignment with their expectations.
- Designed and implemented real-time processing pipelines to enable inline quality control during manufacturing.
- Conducted extensive testing under various lighting conditions and production environments.

## Methodology
- Created a comprehensive dataset of wheel hub images under various production conditions
- Applied advanced image preprocessing techniques to enhance feature detection
- Developed custom YOLO-based models optimized for the specific characteristics of weld seams
- Implemented real-time inference systems capable of operating at production line speeds
- Designed a calibration system to maintain accuracy across different manufacturing stations

## Achievements  
- Successfully deployed in **practical applications** at multiple production facilities.
- Achieved a **detection rate of 99.98%** with **positional accuracy under 0.3 cm**.
- Reduced manual inspection time by over 85% compared to previous methods.
- Decreased defect rates in final products by identifying welding issues at an early stage.
- System has been in continuous operation since deployment with minimal maintenance requirements.

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Computer Vision Libraries**: OpenCV, CUDA
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Deployment**: Industrial edge computing devices, custom hardware integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for defect tracking and quality management

## Impact
This system significantly improved quality control processes at both automotive manufacturers, leading to better product reliability, reduced waste, and enhanced production efficiency. The high accuracy and reliability of the detection system have made it a standard component in the wheel hub manufacturing process.
