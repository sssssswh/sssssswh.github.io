## Project Overview

This project involved working with the Digital & AI team at **Callaghan Innovation** to develop two conversational AI systems: GovGPT and PaperBoi. Both systems use large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide accurate, contextual responses to user queries.

## Key Contributions  
- Enhanced the accuracy and safety of LLM responses by RAG, with a focus on retrieval improvements and prompt engineering.
- Participated in database optimization, data management, and development of indexing strategies to boost the efficiency and contextual relevance of knowledge retrieval.
- Contributed to regular team meetings to share insights and discuss cutting-edge research in the field of LLMs.

## Project Descriptions

**GovGPT** is designed to help Kiwis easily find information about the government and its agencies. It serves as an intelligent interface that can:
- Answer questions about government services and policies
- Guide users to appropriate resources and departments
- Explain complex governmental processes in plain language
- Provide up-to-date information about public services

**PaperBoi** is designed to allow science organizations to index all of their published scientific papers so that companies and the general public can inquire and understand scientific discoveries and related expertise of NZ institutions. It enables:
- Semantic search across large collections of scientific literature
- Question-answering based on the content of research papers
- Exploration of connections between different research areas
- Translation of technical scientific content into accessible explanations

## Tech Stack
- Python, AWS, Azure, LLMs, RAG, GraphRAG, Github, Markdown

## Impact
These systems help bridge the gap between complex information and public understanding, making government services and scientific research more accessible to New Zealanders. They demonstrate the practical application of cutting-edge AI technology to solve real-world information access problems.
