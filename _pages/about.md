## About Me  

I am **Zoey**, a skilled **data scientist** with a strong background in **artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)**. I completed both my **Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees in China** and recently submitted my **Ph.D. thesis at [Victoria University of Wellington] (https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/), New Zealand, in February 2025**.  

Throughout my Ph.D., I collaborated with **[Manaaki Whenua â€“ Landcare Research] (https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/)**, applying AI techniques to solve real-world challenges. Now, I am preparing to start my role as a **Research Assistant at VUW**, where I will continue leveraging AI-driven approaches in research.  

I am currently **open to work** and actively seeking **full-time opportunities** in **data science, AI research, and machine learning engineering**. I am particularly interested in roles that involve **deep learning, optimization, and applied AI solutions** in both academia and industry.
