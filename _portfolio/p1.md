### Key Contributions  
- Developed **advanced deep learning models** for object detection and image segmentation.  
- Leveraged Python libraries such as **OpenCV, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy** to develop a **comprehensive pipeline** for model creation and result analysis.  
- Worked with the team to **assess project progress** and communicated key findings through **reports and presentations**.  

### Achievements  
- Achieved **precise tree crown prediction**, with **10% improvement in detection** and **8% improvement in segmentation accuracy**.  

### Tech Stack  
**Python**, **GitHub**, **YOLO**, **Transformer**
