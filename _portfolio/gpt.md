**GovGPT** is designed to help Kiwis easily find information about the government and its agencies.

**PaperBoi** is designed to allow science organisations to index all of their published scientific papers so that companies and the general public can enquire and understand scientific discoveries and related expertise of NZ institutions.


### Key Contributions  
- Enhanced the accuracy and safety of large language model (LLM) responses by fine-tuning the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, with a focus on retrieval improvements and prompt engineering.
- Participated in database optimization, data management, and development of indexing strategies to boost the efficiency and contextual relevance of knowledge retrieval.
- Participate in regular team meetings to share insights and discuss cutting-edge research in the field of LLMs.
