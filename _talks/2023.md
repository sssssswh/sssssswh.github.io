This talk introduced the use of YOLO for instance segmentation of individual tree crowns, highlighting its efficiency in real-time detection and segmentation. I presented key adaptations of YOLO architectures specifically designed for tree crown analysis and discussed their applications in forestry and environmental monitoring.


## Talk Overview

This talk introduced the use of YOLO for instance segmentation of individual tree crowns, highlighting its efficiency in real-time detection and segmentation. I presented key adaptations of YOLO architectures specifically designed for tree crown analysis and discussed their applications in forestry and environmental monitoring.

## Key Points Covered

- Introduction to the YOLO architecture and its advantages for real-time instance segmentation
- Challenges in tree crown segmentation from aerial imagery
- Adaptations made to YOLO models for improving small object detection in dense canopy settings
- Comparison of detection and segmentation accuracy with other state-of-the-art methods
- Applications in forestry management, biodiversity assessment, and urban planning
