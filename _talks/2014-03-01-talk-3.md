Instance segmentation of individual tree crowns is an important real-world application that facilitates forest management, urban planning, biodiversity modelling, and pest control. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in instance segmentation. Several efforts have successfully applied CNNs to instance segmentation of tree crowns. As a representative instance segmentation method, Mask R-CNN shows good performance in the application of instance segmentation of individual tree crowns. However, Mask R-CNN with ResNet or ResNeXt is not enough to extract sufficient feature information for individual tree crowns. In this paper, an improved Mask R-CNN method is proposed by introducing an effective backbone structure. Furthermore, we propose a new mask branch to help segment tree crowns from complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that the new method can effectively identify and segment individual tree canopies for the Wellington city of Aotearoa New Zealand dataset.
