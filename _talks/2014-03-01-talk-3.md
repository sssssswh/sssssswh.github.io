Instance segmentation of individual tree crowns is crucial for forest management, urban planning, and biodiversity modeling. While CNNs, especially Mask R-CNN, have shown success in this task, traditional backbones like ResNet struggle to extract sufficient features. In this work, we propose an improved Mask R-CNN with an enhanced backbone and a new mask branch for better segmentation in complex backgrounds. Our method effectively identifies and segments tree canopies in the Wellington dataset, demonstrating superior performance.
